							Recently e-learning systems are experiencing rapid development. The advantages of learning through a global network are manifold and obvious: the independence of time and space, learners can learn at their own pace, learning materials can be organized in one place and used-processed all around the world. One of the most important segments in todayâ€™s development and use of the e-learning system is the personalization of content and building of user profiles based on the learning behaviour of each individual user. The personalization options increase efficiency of e-learning, thus justifying the higher initial cost of their construction. In order to personalize the learning process and adapt content to each learner, e-learning systems can use strategies that have the ability to meet the needs of learners. Also, these systems have to use different technologies to change the environment and perform the adaptation of teaching materials based on the needs of learners. The process of adaptation can be in the form of adaptation of content, learning process, feedback or navigation.
